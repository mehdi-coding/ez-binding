# ez-binding
An Easy library for 2 ways data binding

# Description
I did this library as part of the [spa-electron](https://github.com/mehdi-coding/spa-electron) framework.

This library needs 0 config, just include it in you HTML, add ez-Model attribute, and you will be able to access the variables via ezModel Object.

Check the [example](https://github.com/mehdi-coding/ez-binding/tree/master/example) folder and you will realize that it is easy :)

### Drawback
it has poor browsers compatibility : (

but it works fine on modern browsers (tested on chrome, firefox & opera) and electron :)

# To-Do

- Add Getters & Setters
- Try to improve compatibility (maybe)
- Keep it simple :)
