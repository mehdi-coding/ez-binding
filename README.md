# ez-binding
An Easy library for 2 way data binding

# Description
I did this library as part of the [spa-electron](https://github.com/mehdi-coding/spa-electron) framework.

This library need 0 config, just include it in you HTML, add ez-Model attribute, and you will be able to access the variables via ezModel Object.
